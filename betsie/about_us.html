        <h1>Betsie – About Us</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: November 17, 2025</p>

        <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Laetitia and Kat met in 2016 and have been friends and colleagues ever since. Working and playing side-by-side led to many friendly bets over the years. One afternoon over coffee they realized they, and the world, needed a product (Betsie) where they could track their bets and keep score of who was ahead in the “I told you so” game of life!</p>
